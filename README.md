About Me
---

I am a graduating student who is currently persuing my PHD degree in department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in National University of Singapore. I successfully maintained Distinction degree in my bachelor courses as a Mechanical Engineering student. I have strong skills in do 3D modelling. 
I am experienced in both hardware and software skills. I did study and projects on some Python projects using such as Mediapipe, OPenCV, and  Keras. Also, I am able to use IOT hardwares including sensors and STM32/ESP32 in my projects to either control or retrieve data for monitoring health or environmental condition.
